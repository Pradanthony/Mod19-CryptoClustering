# Mod19-CryptoClustering
Data on Crypto currencies were used for this assignment.
The main task was to find the kmeans value of the original data using the elbow method.
Then using that kmeans a scatter plot was derived showing the differemt clusters in the data.
The second part was very interesting!
PCA was used on this original data and converted intop three components or features.
PCA data was used to find the kmeans using the elbow chart and then the clustering in the scatter plot.
Finally both elbow chart and clustering scatter plot was compared to identify the impact of using PCA.
In this case the impact was minimal with good explained variance of 0.89 ehich indicates the accuracy of the data was not compromised too much to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
